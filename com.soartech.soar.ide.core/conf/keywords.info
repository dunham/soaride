# 
# Basic Commands
#

excise=Delete Soar productions from production memory.

help=Provide formatted, on-line information about Soar commands.

init-soar=Reinitialize Soar so a program can be rerun from scratch.

quit=Close log file, terminate Soar, and return user to the operating system.

# This is an example of a more detailed description.  Right now it is not
# displayed with newlines in the content assist and does not break on word boundaries
# so it is not very pretty.
sp=sp {production_body} \
The sp command creates a new production and loads it into production memory.  \
"production_body" is a single argument parsed by the Soar kernel, so it should be enclosed \
in curly braces to avoid being parsed by other scripting languages that might \
be in the same process. The overall syntax of a rule is as follows:\
\
name\
["documentation-string"]\
[FLAG*]\
LHS\
-->\
RHS
