	    <h3>Why am I getting an out of memory error?</h3>
		<p>The Eclipse default memory settings are set in the eclipse.ini file located in the 
		root of your Eclipse installation, and are as follows:<p>
		
		<p>
		-vmargs<br>
		-Xms40m<br>
		-Xmx256m</p>

		<p>This is ok for most users, but these settings can be tweaked by editing eclipse.ini file. 
		This will give some more room for plugins (like the Soar IDE) that need additional memory.</p>
		
		<p>To fix the problem, change the values to match the following:</p>
		
		<p>
		-vmargs<br>
		-Xms128m<br>
		-Xmx512m</p>

        <h3>A file says it doesn't belong to any agents</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure Include Soar Project Support is selected for the Eclipse project</li>
            <li>Make sure there is at least one Soar Agent for that project</li>
            <li>Make sure the file is selected in that .soaragent file</li>
            <li>If you change any of these things while the file is open, it may not refresh until you close and reopen it</li>

            <li>Make sure the Tcl expansion is enabled (toggle the icon on the top-right of the Source Viewer)</li>
            <li>Make sure there are no outstanding syntax errors in the agent</li>
            <li>Make sure you are selecting a call to a Tcl macro, not the Tcl macro definition</li>
