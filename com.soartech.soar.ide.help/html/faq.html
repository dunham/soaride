	    <h3>Why am I getting an out of memory error?</h3>
		<p>The Eclipse default memory settings are set in the eclipse.ini file located in the 
		root of your Eclipse installation, and are as follows:<p>
		
		<p>
		-vmargs<br>
		-Xms40m<br>
		-Xmx256m</p>

		<p>This is ok for most users, but these settings can be tweaked by editing eclipse.ini file. 
		This will give some more room for plugins (like the Soar IDE) that need additional memory.</p>
		
		<p>To fix the problem, change the values to match the following:</p>
		
		<p>
		-vmargs<br>
		-Xms128m<br>
		-Xmx512m</p>
