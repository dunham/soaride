		<p>If an agent is modified externally to the agent editor, say through the links at
		the top of the Soar file editor, the open agent editor does not notice the changes.</p>

		<p>When changes are made externally, the agent editor should notice and pop up the
		standard "Reload changes from disk?" dialog box.</p>
		
		
		<h3>SoarTech Bug #1402: "Not reachable" warning</h3>

		is performed</p>
