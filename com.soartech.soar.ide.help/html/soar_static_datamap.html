	    <p>
	    The static datamap gives the user the ability to define expected data structures, and then perform static checking
	    on the code to see if it creates or tests any unexpected data structures. This can help find bugs and typos.
        </p>
	

		<h3>Static Datamap</h3>
		
		<p>
		The static datamap exists as a .dm file in the base directory of your soar project.
		</p>
		
		<ul>
		  <li>
		  Create a new static datamap by right clicking on your project and selecting New -> Soar Datamap and giving it a name.
		  </li>
		  <li>
		  The static datamap opens itself as an editor, it is not displayed in a different view like the dynamic datamap.
		  </li>
		  <li>
		  There are two tabs in the static datamap editor: one with a tree-view which can be manipulated through context menus, 
		  and one with the raw text model.
		  </li>
		  <li>
          Interact with the static datamap by right-clicking on the tree to add/edit children and validate against the project.
          </li>
		</ul>
