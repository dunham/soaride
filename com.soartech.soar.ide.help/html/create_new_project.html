	    <h3>Create a new Soar Project</h3>
		
		<p>In Eclipse, files exist within projects, so before we create any files,
		we must first create a new project for them to be a part of.</p>

		<p>To create a new general project, right-click in the Package Explorer view and 
		choose <b>New -> Project</b>. </p>
		
		<p>This opens the <b>New Project</b> wizard dialog which contains wizards for every 
		type of project Eclipse knows about. In order to provide support for Soar within 
		multiple project types, there is no specific "Soar" project type. Instead, we
		have the ability to set "Soar Project Support" on any type of project so that
		it understands Soar.</p>
		
		<div style="margin-left:20px;"><ul>
		<li><i><b>Note:</b> If we wanted to integrate Soar into a Java project, we would instead
		create a Java project here. This applies, in general, to other languages as well.</i></li>
		</ul></div>
		
		<p>Since we will just be writing Soar code, choose <b>General -> 
		Project</b> from the list of project wizards and click <b>Next</b>.</p>
		
		<p>Now we need to name the new project. Type a name, such as "helloworld" 
		in the <b>Project name</b> field.</p> 

		<p>Once this is done, click <b>Finish</b> to create the project.</p>
		
		<p>The newly created project is now displayed in the Package Explorer.</p>
		
		<div style="text-align: center"><img src="../content/soaride_break_800.png" width ="400"></div>

		<p>Empty projects do not provide Soar support automatically. There are two ways to get them to 
		however:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Create a new soar agent for the project.</li>
			
			<li><b>Right-click</b> on the project in the <b>Package Explorer</b> and choose
			<b>Include Soar Project Support</b>.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<br><br>
		<div style="margin-left:20px;"><ul>
		<li><i><b>Note:</b> We can tell that a project has Soar Support by the "s" decoration
		on the project icon in the Package Explorer.
		</i></ul></div>
