	    <h3>Create a new Soar File</h3>
	
		<p>Now that we have an empty project with Soar support, we can create a new 
		Soar file for that project.</p>
		
		<p>To add a new file to the project, right-click on the project and 
		choose <b>New -> Soar File</b>.
		
		<p>The <b>New Soar File</b> dialog should now appear on the screen. This 
		dialog handles the creation of Soar files, and will automatically add the
		.soar extension to your new file.</p>
		
		<p>Enter a name for the new Soar file in the <b>File name</b> field and
		click <b>Finish</b> to create it and add it to the project.</p>
		
		<div style="margin-left:20px;"><ul>
		<li><i><b>Note:</b> The project that was initially selected when the <b>New Soar File</b>
		wizard was activated is automatically selected as the parent folder 
		when the file is created in this way.</i></li></ul></div>
