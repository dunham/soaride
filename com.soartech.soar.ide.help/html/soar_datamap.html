		<p>
		The dynamic datamap is generated by running an analysis of the productions in 
		the project to create a depiction of the soar memory structure.
		</p>

		<h3>Datamap Table</h3>
		
		<p>Elements in the datamap table are attributes that are tested against states 
		in productions.</p>
		
		<img src="../content/soar_datamap.png" alt="" class="right">
		
		<ul>
			<li>Click on an attribute to display the list of corresponding productions in which 
			the attribute was tested or created.</li>
			
			<li><b>Ctrl-click</b> multiple attributes to display the intersection of productions 
			corresponding with those attributes.</li>
			
			<li>Each attribute has some combination of '+' and '?' descriptors associated with 
			it. The '+' descriptor means that the attribute was created on the RHS, and 
			the '?' descriptor means that the attribute was tested on the LHS.</li>
			
			<li>You can generate a production that monitors selected attributes by right-clicking 
			on them and choosing <b>Generate Monitor Production</b> from the context menu. The 
			generated production tests for the selected attributes on the LHS.</li>
			
			<li>The <b>Values</b> column in the table displays values that the attributes are 
			tested against or created with.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<br><br>
		<h3>Production List</h3>
		<p>
		The production list displays productions that correspond to selected attributes 
		in the Soar Datamap. 
		<ul>
			<li>Select a production here to display it in the source viewer.</li> 
			<li>Double-click a production to open the file it is located in and 
			display it in an editor.</li> 
			<li>Error and warning markers decorate the displayed elements 
			according to the status of the model.</li>
		</ul>
